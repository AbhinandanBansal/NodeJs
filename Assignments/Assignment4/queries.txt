Create movies collection
db.createCollection("movies")

1) Add 5 movies to the collection, every movie document should include the following properties: 
name, genre, rating (out of 10) and language
db.movies.insertMany([{"name":"Sully","genre":"Drama","rating":10,"language":"English"},
{"name":"End Game","genre":"Action","rating":6,"language":"English"},
{"name":"MI-4","genre":"Action","rating":7,"language":"English"},{"name":"Disney Frozen-I","genre":"cartoon","rating":8,"language":"English"},{"name":"Disney Frozen-II","genre":"cartoon","rating":9,"language":"English"}])

2) Write a query that returns all the movies
db.movies.find().pretty()

3) Write a query to find anyone movie name using findOne method (Do not use limit() method)
db.movies.findOne({},{name:1})
db.movies.findOne({"name":"Sully"},{name:1})


4) Write a query that returns the three highest rated movies
db.movies.find().sort({rating:-1}).limit(3)

5) Add a key called achievements in any two documents. One document should have ‘Super hit’ and other should have ‘Super Duper Hit’ as value to key achievements. This task should be performed in two ways-
i. Using update() method
db.movies.update({'name':'Sully'},{$set:{'achievements':'Super Duper hit'}})
db.movies.update({'name':'Disney Frozen-II'},{$set:{'achievements':'Super hit'}})

ii. Using save() method
db.movies.save( { _id : ObjectId("5f030d685537cf7dd5eae893"), "name":"End Game","genre":"Action","rating":6,"language":"English", achievements : "Super hit" } )
db.movies.save( { _id : ObjectId("5f030d685537cf7dd5eae894"), "name":"MI-4","genre":"Action","rating":7,"language":"English", achievements : "Super Duper hit" } )


6) Write a query that returns all the movies that have both the ‘Super hit’ and the ‘Super Duper hit’’ achievements
db.movies.find({"achievements":{$in:["Super hit","Super Duper hit"]}})

7) Write a query that returns only those movies that have achievements
db.movies.find( { achievements: { $exists: true} } )
